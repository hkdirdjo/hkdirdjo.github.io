							<p>
								I have been working on a high-resolution LiDAR scanner using a pair of low-power stepper motors and a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14032">LiDAR-Lite v3</a>. 
								I was inspired by the masterful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGN82vLjguI">David Cambridge</a> but wanted to make a lighter, more portable version. 
								Using timing belt gear reductions, I was able to achieve +/- 0.45 degree accuracy, which is within the angular resolution of the Lidar-Lite.
								The first version used a 3D printed chassis and was used for the first scan you can see below.

							<span class="image left"><img src="images/LiDAR/SecondVersion.png" alt="" /></span>							
							<p>
								The second version (at left) uses a composite chassis with 1/8" aluminium sandwiching a 3D printed honeycomb. 
								This allowed for higher stiffness and precision, lower second moment of inertia, and a more tightly integrated design while maintaining weight.
								I had intended to use microstepping to decrease the mechanical complexity of the device, but the stepper motors may not be able to provide enough torque.
								However, this may just be a limitation of the current that can be provided by my power supply - more testing is required.
								The software, written in C++ for Arduino, has a unique scan pattern to conserve power, and will convert the requested scan resolution to the closest one supported by microstepping.
							</p>
							<p>
								Version three of the project will focus on maximizing the scan rate. 
								I will likely switch over to DC motors with encoders so that the LiDAR can scan with a constant angular velocity (as opposed to individual steps) without fear of losing steps.
